<h1>Python Assignment 2</h1>

<b>Task Description:</b>
<br>
Write a Python program that utilizes a for loop and a while loop inside it to solve the following problem:
<br><br>
<b>Problem 1 Statement:</b><br>
You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to print a pattern of numbers from 1 to n in the following format:
<br><br>
1<br>
2 2<br>
3 3 3<br>
4 4 4 4<br>
...<br>
n n n n ... n<br>
<br><br>
Each row should contain the numbers from 1 to the row number, inclusive, repeated according to the row number. For example, in row 3, the number 3 should appear three times.
<br><br>
<b>For Example:</b><br>
If n = 5, your program should print the following pattern:<br>
1<br>
2 2<br>
3 3 3<br>
4 4 4 4<br>
5 5 5 5 5<br>
<br><br>
<b>Requirements:</b><br>
Use a for loop to iterate through the rows from 1 to n. Inside the for loop, use a while loop to print the numbers according to the row number. Make sure to include appropriate indentation and line breaks to match the pattern format.
<br><br>
<b>Hints:</b>
<br><br>
You can use a variable to keep track of the current number to print. Use a separate variable to control the repetition of the number based on the row number. Ensure that each row ends with a newline character (\n) to create the desired pattern.
<br><br>

<b>Problem 2: Counting Odd Numbers</b><br>
Write a Python program that takes an integer n as input and prints all the odd numbers from 1 to n using a for loop and a while loop.
<br><br>
<b>For Example:</b><br>
Enter a number: 7<br>
Odd numbers from 1 to 7:<br>
1<br>
3<br>
5<br>
7<br>
