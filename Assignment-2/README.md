Assignment No.2

Task Description:
Write a Python program that utilizes a for loop and a while loop inside it to solve the
following problem:

Problem Statement:
You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to print a pattern of numbers from 1
to n in the following format:
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
...
n n n n ... n

Each row should contain the numbers from 1 to the row number, inclusive, repeated
according to the row number. For example, in row 3, the number 3 should appear
three times.

For Example:
If n = 5, your program should print the following pattern:
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

Requirements:

Use a for loop to iterate through the rows from 1 to n.
Inside the for loop, use a while loop to print the numbers according to the row
number.
Make sure to include appropriate indentation and line breaks to match the pattern
format.

Hints:

You can use a variable to keep track of the current number to print.
Use a separate variable to control the repetition of the number based on the row
number.
Ensure that each row ends with a newline character (\n) to create the desired pattern.

Problem 2: Counting Odd Numbers
Write a Python program that takes an integer n as input and prints all the odd
numbers from 1 to n using a for loop and a while loop.
For Example:
Enter a number: 7
Odd numbers from 1 to 7:
1
3
5
7
